    <p>
      I have worked on a bunch of side projects in my spare time. The
      projects vary drastically, but have one thing in common: they
      were all fun to work on. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the projects were solo efforts, but many of the others
      would not have been possible without help from some eminently
      competent friends. Overall, these were the more fun
      projects. I've linked to the websites of my collaborators for
      every project; they are all worth visiting.

      High School

    <p>
      While I did a bunch of programming before high school, I never
      made much worth keeping. Additionally, I didn't use source
      control or have backups; predictably, I do not have most of my
      really early work. Luckily it's only interesting as a window
      into my personal development, so it's not a significant
      loss. And I learned a valuable lesson: I now let the rest of the
      world back my work up for me.

    <p>
      My last project in high school was a web-based chess game. I had
      initially started it in my sophomore year in an effort to learn
      prototype.js, but wrote myself into a corner. I rewrote it from
      the ground up my senior year (still using prototype),
      and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~jacobt">Jacob Taylor</a>
      ported his LISP chess AI to JavaScript for it.
