title: Letting Experts Be Experts

The most effective teams I've seen have always left room for people to *be* experts and to *become* experts. But what does this actually entail? 

What does it mean to be an expert or to have expertise?

A solid starting point is the [recognition-primed decision making][rpd] (RPD) model, covered in Gary Klein's [*Sources of Power*][sources-of-power]. At a high level, the model seems obvious: **experts make decisions by finding parallels—consciously or subconsciously—between the current situation and their past experience**. 

Of course, we shouldn't dismiss an idea just because it seems obvious. This view of expertise has non-obvious nuances and consequences that I've seen in qualitative research (including the case studies described in *Sources of Power*) as well as my own experience. More importantly, I've seen too many managers and organizations act in ways inconsistent with this idea to take even the high-level formulation for granted!
