* Doing /as/ Planning
I shared this article with a few friends, and multiple people cited
the point about /not/ having a clear separation between planning and
execution as the most important point in the piece.

Planning is not a simple unified activity, and it's valuable to take a
step back and see it that way.

* Examples
Kaveh had a great point about examples: the article would have been
more effective if I backed up the parts where I said "in my
experience..." with examples and illustrations. I really appreciate
this feedback; I'm definitely going to keep it in mind for future
things I write (like that "thinking in libraries" post I'm already
working on!), but I'm also thinking of going back and adding examples
to /this/ post, even though almost nobody is going to read the updated
version...
