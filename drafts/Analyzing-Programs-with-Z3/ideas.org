* Idea
  - reason about programs *exhaustively* (within bounds)
  - answer arbitrary questions
    - check invariants
    - verify against specification
    - run forwards/backwards (!)
    - synthesize code

* IMP
  - simple language: booleans, ints, control flow
  - used to teach PL theory (esp operational semantics)

** Syntax

* Unrolling Execution
  - we compile a program to a formula by *unrolling* the execution of
    the program to /n/ steps
