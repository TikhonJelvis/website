I often work on random programming projects in my spare time. This is a collection of my projects that seem at least moderately interesting. I haven't put all of my projects here yet. Also, some of the ones I have put on here are still works in progress: nothing is guaranteed to work!

I wrote some of these projects on my own. However, most of the particularly fun ones were done with others' help. I've tried to link to my collaborators' sites on the appropriate projects; they are all worth visiting.
