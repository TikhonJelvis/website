<div class="content">

I often work on random programming projects in my spare time. This is a collection of my projects that seem at least moderately interesting. I haven't put all of my projects here yet. Also, some of the ones I have put on here are still works in progress: nothing is guaranteed to work!

I wrote some of these projects on my own. However, most of the particularly fun ones were done with others' help. I've tried to link to my collaborators' sites on the appropriate projects; they are all worth visiting.

Here are some of those projects. They vary from silly little things I wrote in a couple of days to more interesting projects that took weeks or months. 

* <span class="tpl"> [tpl](/tpl) </span>
  A simple but flexible dynamically typed scripting language.

* [Cow](/cow)
  A proof-of-concept for a diff and merge tool that looks at your code semantically.

* [Drawing](/draw)
  A little toy for drawing pictures from mathematical functions---it can be a lot of fun!

* [Maze](/maze)
  Exploring randomly generated mazes with JavaScript and canvas.

* [Cards](/cards)
  A library for writing card games in JavaScript, written at an 18-hour hackathon.

* [Chess](/chess)
  A JavaScript chess game I wrote with a friend in high school. 

* [Simulation](/simulation)
  A 2d physics engine supporting polygons and circles that I wrote with a friend in high school.
