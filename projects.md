# Projects

## Current

[Cow: Semantic Version Control](/cow)
  ~ A proof-of-concept diff and merge tool that looks at the structure of code rather than just text.

[Mote.el][mote-el]
  ~ ![A screenshot of mote showing type info and suggestions for a hole.][mote-screenshot]
    An Emacs mode for interacting with typed holes in Haskell, based on Izaak Meckler's [mote] tool.

## Ludum Dare

I've participated in two [Ludum Dare game jams][ld] which involve building a game in 72 hours with a small team.

[Shattered Worlds](/shattered-worlds)
  ~ A platformer where you can overlay a map from any level you've passed on top of the current level.

[Asteroid Tycoon](/asteroid-tycoon)
  ~ A tunneling game where you buy self-destructing robots to mine through asteroids.

## Haskell

Some projects involving Haskell. Also check out my [blog](/blog) which tends to focus on Haskell and functional programming.

<span class="tpl"> [TPL](/tpl) </span>
  ~ A simple but flexible dynamically typed scripting language. Has a mostly working implementation, but was abandoned because of design issues. (Designing a language is hard!)

[modular-arithmetic][ma-github]
  ~ a simple library [on Hackage][ma-hackage] for creating integral types modulo some constant, like ``Integer `Mod` 10`` or, with some Unicode and operator goodness, `ℤ/10`.

[FRP](/frp)
  ~ My final project for CS 263, a survey of functional reactive programming (FRP) and the rich theory behind it. Includes an elegant [game of life][reactive-life] app which I keep on meaning to turn into a tutorial…

## Misc

[Drawing](/draw)
  ~ A little toy for drawing pictures from mathematical functions---it can be a lot of fun!

[Maze](/maze)
  ~ Exploring randomly generated mazes with JavaScript and canvas. (Also see my [blog post][maze-post] about graphs and mazes in Haskell.)

[maze-post]: /blog/Generating-Mazes-with-Inductive-Graphs

[JS Scheme](/scheme)
  ~ A basic Scheme interpreter written in JavaScript. Does not support *all* of Scheme (e.g. no macros or continuations), unfortunately.

[Cards](/cards)
  ~ A library for writing card games in JavaScript, entirely created at an 18-hour hackathon.

## High School

Here are a couple of projects I worked on back in high school. (The rest, unfortunately, are lost to time.) Old, but still pretty neat!

[Chess](/chess)
  ~ A JavaScript chess game with an AI developed by [Jessica Taylor][jessica], a friend.

[Simulation](/simulation)
  ~ A 2D physics engine supporting polygons and circles, written with [Jessica Taylor][jessica].
