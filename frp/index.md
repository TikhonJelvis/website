# Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)

Functional reactive programming (usually referred to as FRP) is a novel way of writing reactive systems like user interfaces and games. Essentially, FRP can be used wherever you would normally use an event/observer callback-based style.

## Slides

I recently did a survey of FRP for one of my CS classes. At the end of the semester, I gave a presentation on the subject. Here are my [slides](slides.html). (Note: The slides currently don't work on Firefox, sorry.)

The slides are a little terse and cover both more theoretical and more practical topics.

In the near future, I'm going to write a nice little tutorial on FRP with Reactive-Banana based on the demo I wrote for this presentation.
