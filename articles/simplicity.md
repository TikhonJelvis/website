# Blogging

So. A blog.

I've been meaning to start writing more for a while now, in part to help me figure out what I think about the world and why I think it. And here I am: writing about something just to not write about nothing. 

Earlier, I thought I'd limit myself to topics where I can contribute something genuinely novel. But high standards were never my thing, and writing about anything (and everything) just seems more fun. 

And so I'll begin with an idea that's starting to dominate my worldview: simplicity. 

## Simple

What is simplicity? That, alas, is not itself a simple question and so I'll leave it for later. Instead: why? Why choose simplicity as a guiding princple? What does that even mean?
