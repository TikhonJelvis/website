# Blogging

So. A blog.

I've been meaning to start one for a while now. At the very least, I keep talking about it! Any day now... Well, how about today? 

Of course, I need a nice topic to start. I have several half-written articles lying around, but they are too long, too involved and too technical. Instead, I'll start by writing about why I want to write. Not the most inspired of topics, but I'm really writing about something just not to write about nothing.

## Why

The core question: why do this at all? The answer is more surprising to me than to anyone else: fun. Over time, almost without noticing, I've actually come to enjoy writing. 

This is unexpected; even recently I simply *hated* writing. In freshman year of high school, there was little I dreaded more. And no wonder---I was *terrible*. Writing took effort, drained me of energy and, worst of all, gave me poor results. I could not imagine ever enjoying it.

Then, at some point, I started to improve and, consequently, like it. For a while I didn't even realize---from sheer force of habit, I would dread writing assignments, then enjoy actually doing them! 

Since then, I've done a fair amount of writing for classes and online (SO and HN), but never anything more freeform. I'd like to broaden my writing a bit, try new things and just get more practice; a blog is the perfect outlet for all of these. 

The most important point is that I write to write, not to be read. 

## What

Earlier, I thought I'd limit myself to topics where I can contribute something genuinely novel. But high standards were never my thing, and writing about anything (and everything) just seems more fun. 

I'm certainly going to write about various technical topics, with my usual focus on programming languages, functional programming and program synthesis. There's always something to write there, but that's only one kind of writing. I want to diversify. So I'm also going to write about whatever else catches my attention, even if I'm woefully underqualified.

For better or worse, this means I won't have any coherent theme here. Just a random collection of stuff I've randomly written. Poorly. Perhaps that will just make it all the more exciting.
