Perhaps the scariest thing I've recently realized is how my emotions are somewhat random and completely out of my control. Outwardly I appear calm and content, but I am actually skirting on the edge of panic. And why? I really don't know. I am listless and restless: I lack the energy to do anything---even fall asleep.

Sure, I have problems. But nothing *immediate*. And yet.

The biggest surprise is that it took me so long to see this. I suppose I've always known abstractly, but never felt it viscerally---never truly believed it. In the past, I've always been somewhat out of touch with my emotions and have always kept them in check. I was certainly anxious, but never for long times: it was always localized, related to something upcoming---an assignment or a fencing tournament or whatever else---and, most importantly, quickly over. A few hours or maybe a couple of days, never more. Chronic anxiety was entirely foreign, something that happened to other people.

But now, and I'm not sure why, this has changed. I've spent months despondent, worrying and neglecting everything.
