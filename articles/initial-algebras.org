* Algebraic Data Types as Initial algebras

** Basic idea
   - relate ADTs, f-algebras, folds and initial algebras
   - a fold is like the unique homomorphism from an initial algebra to
     some other algebra
     - remember the type signature:
       - =fold :: Functor f => (f a -> a) -> (Fix f -> a)=
       - =fold :: Algebra f a => Fix f -> a=
     - how can we rephrase this in terms of a homomorphism from the
       initial algebra?

** Bananas
   - this probably has something to do with bananas
   - I bet it's the definition of a catamorphism or something equally
     fundamental :(
     - still interesting to work out and explain
