# Reasoning under Uncertainty

![A screenshot of my online Haskell.love talk.][screenshot]

My first-ever virtual talk! I gave an introduction to Markov Decision Processes in Haskell at [Haskell.love 2020][haskell-love]. I had a lot of funâ€”giving a talk without seeing the audience was a bit weird at first but, overall, I actually preferred it.
