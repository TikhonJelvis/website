# Analyzing Programs with Z3

I have a simple formula compiler for IMP using the [Haskell Z3 bindings][haskell-z3] up on [GitHub][code]. I built it with Nix so I was really lazy on setting bounds in the cabal file. If it doesn't build for you, please tell me!

I'll have slides and a recording of the talk up later.

I originally learned this material taking a [class on program synthesis][class] taught by Ras Bodik at Berkeley. Lectures and materials are available online. If you want to read about the topic further, I also have a random selection of papers, also [on GitHub][bibliography].
