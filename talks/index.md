# Talks

Here are the slides for talks I've given at meetups. Presenting is fun! Unfortunately, most were not recorded. I included links to videos for the ones that were.

My older slides were produced with a customized version of [org-html5presentation.el](https://gist.github.com/kinjo/509761) that does not work properly in Firefox. I've included pdf versions of most of these that are ugly but should be readable. Newer slides, based on [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) (Still built from [org mode](https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal)) should work properly.

## SF Types, Theorems and Programming Languages

I gave a series of talks introducing type theory at the [SF Types, Theorems and Programming Languages](http://www.meetup.com/SF-Types-Theorems-and-Programming-Languages/) meetup at [Mixrank](http://mixrank.com) HQ, going from the untyped λ-calculus to dependent types.

  * [Untyped Lambda Calculus](untyped-lambda-calculus.html) ([pdf](untyped-lambda-calculus.pdf))
  * [Simply Typed Lambda Calculus](stlc.html) ([pdf](stlc.pdf))
  * [Fun with Curry-Howard](curry-howard.html) ([pdf](curry-howard.pdf))
  * [Polymorphism---System F](system-f.html) ([pdf](system-f.pdf))
  * [Dependent Types](dependent-types.html) ([pdf](dependent-types.pdf))
  
## Haskell

I've given a few talks at Haskell hackathons and meetups.

<div></div>

[SF Haskell meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Haskell-Users-Group/) at [Wagon](http://wagonhq.com):

  * [Inductive Graphs](inductive-graphs-at-wagon)

A longer talk at [BayHac 2015](http://bayhac.org):

  * [Thinking with Laziness](thinking-with-laziness) ([video](http://begriffs.com/posts/2015-06-17-thinking-with-laziness.html))

[Haskell Hackers meetup][haskell-hackers] (at Hacker Dojo):

  * [Nondeterminism](nondeterminism.html) 
  * [Inductive Graphs](inductive-graphs.html) (my newer talk at Wagon is better)
  * [Analyzing Programs with SMT Solvers](analyzing-programs-with-smt.html)

Two lightning talks at [BayHac 2013](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/BayHac2013):

  * [Program Synthesis for ArrayForth](af-slides.html)
  * [Algebras and Coalgebras](algebras.html) (based on a [post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16015020/what-does-coalgebra-mean-in-the-context-of-programming/16022059#16022059) I wrote)

I also gave a longer talk at [Hac φ 2013](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hac_%CF%86):

  * [Program synthesis](synthesis-slides.html) ([pdf](synthesis-slides.pdf)) (a general overview)

## FRP 

I recently did a survey of functional reactive programming (FRP) for one of my CS classes. At the end of the semester, I gave a presentation on the subject:

  * [Introduction to FRP](frp-slides.html)
