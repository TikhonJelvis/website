# Talks

Here are the slides for a few technical talks that I have recently given.

The slides work directly in the browser with JavaScript. Use the arrows to navigate back and forth. I'm going to provide PDF versions of all of the talks at some point, but the formatting may not be as good as the JavaScript version.

Unfortunately, the slides do not work correctly in FireFox. I'll fix it, any day now...

As a technical note, the slides are generated from [org-mode](http://orgmode.org), using a modified version of  [org-html5presentation.el](https://gist.github.com/kinjo/509761). Both the modified `.el` script and the org files for talks are up on [github](https://github.com/TikhonJelvis/talks).

Unlike the regular script, my version breaks in FireFox :P. The equations are rendered with [MathJax](http://mathjax.org), which is a really awesome library.

## SF Types, Theorems and Programming Languages

I gave a series of talks introducing type theory at the [SF Types, Theorems and Programming Languages](http://www.meetup.com/SF-Types-Theorems-and-Programming-Languages/) meetup at [Mixrank](http://mixrank.com) HQ, going from the untyped λ-calculus to dependent types.

  * [Untyped Lambda Calculus](untyped-lambda-calculus.html) ([pdf](untyped-lambda-calculus.pdf))
  * [Simply Typed Lambda Calculus](stlc.html) ([pdf](stlc.pdf))
  * [Fun with Curry-Howard](curry-howard.html) ([pdf](curry-howard.pdf))
  * [Polymorphism---System F](system-f.html) ([pdf](system-f.pdf))
  * [Dependent Types](dependent-types.html) ([pdf](dependent-types.pdf))
  
## Haskell

I've given a few talks at Haskell hackathons and meetups.

<div></div>

[Haskell Hackers meetup][haskell-hackers] (at Hacker Dojo):

  * [Nondeterminism](nondeterminism.html) 
  * [Inductive Graphs](inductive-graphs.html)
  * [Analyzing Programs with SMT Solvers](analyzing-programs-with-smt.html)

Two lightning talks at [BayHac 2013](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/BayHac2013):

  * [Program Synthesis for ArrayForth](af-slides.html)
  * [Algebras and Coalgebras](algebras.html) (based on a [post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16015020/what-does-coalgebra-mean-in-the-context-of-programming/16022059#16022059) I wrote)

I also gave a longer talk at [Hac φ 2013](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hac_%CF%86):

  * [Program synthesis](synthesis-slides.html) ([pdf](synthesis-slides.pdf)) (a general overview)

## FRP 

I recently did a survey of functional reactive programming (FRP) for one of my CS classes. At the end of the semester, I gave a presentation on the subject:

  * [Introduction to FRP](frp-slides.html)
