# Talks

Here are the slides for a few technical talks that I have recently given.

The slides work directly in the browser with JavaScript. Use the arrows to navigate back and forth. I'm going to provide PDF versions of all of the talks at some point, but the formatting may not be as good as the JavaScript version.

Unfortunately, the slides do not work correctly in FireFox. I'll fix it, any day now...

As a technical note, the slides are generated from [org-mode](http://orgmode.org), using a modified version of  [org-html5presentation.el](https://gist.github.com/kinjo/509761). I haven't released the modifications, but they're mostly just changing the colors and typefaces. Also, unlike the regular script, my version breaks in FireFox :P. The equations are rendered with [MathJax](http://mathjax.org), which is a really awesome library.

## SF Types, Theorems and Programming Languages

I'm giving a series of talks introducing type theory at the [SF Types, Theorems and Programming Languages](http://www.meetup.com/SF-Types-Theorems-and-Programming-Languages/) meetup at [Mixrank](http://mixrank.com) HQ.

So far, I've given three talks about the lambda calculus:

  * [Untyped Lambda Calculus](untyped-lambda-calculus.html) ([pdf](untyped-lambda-calculus.pdf))
  * [Simply Typed Lambda Calculus](stlc.html) ([pdf](stlc.pdf))
  * [Fun with Curry-Howard](curry-howard.html) ([pdf](curry-howard.pdf))
  
## Haskell

I've given a few talks at Haskell hackathons. First, there were two lightning talks at [BayHac 2013](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/BayHac2013):

  * [Program Synthesis for ArrayForth](af-slides.html)
  * [Algebras and Coalgebras](algebras.html) (based on a [post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16015020/what-does-coalgebra-mean-in-the-context-of-programming/16022059#16022059) I wrote)

I also gave a longer talk at [Hac Ï† 2013](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hac_%CF%86):

  * [Program synthesis](synthesis-slides.html) (a general overview)

## FRP 

I recently did a survey of functional reactive programming (FRP) for one of my CS classes. At the end of the semester, I gave a presentation on the subject:

  * [Introduction to FRP](frp-slides.html)
