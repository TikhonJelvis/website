  R&eacute;sum&eacute;/CV

<p>
  I have a nice
  <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/tikhonjelvis"> 
    HTML R&eacute;sum&eacute;/CV</a> at
  StackOverflow Careers.

  Old Paper R&eacute;sum&eacute;
</h2>
<p>
  I used to maintain a paper r&eacute;sum&eacute; in LaTeX but have
  since decided to use the StackOverflow one exclusively. However, you
  can still find a somewhat-outdated copy of
  it <a href="../resume.pdf">here</a>. Since I haven't updated it
  since the end of my last school year, it's probably more interesting
  as a testament to LaTex than for its contents.

  Other Sites
</h2>
<p>
  Apart from my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, I think
  my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/286871/tikhon-jelvis">StackOverflow
  profile</a> (not careers.stackoverflow)
  and <a href="http://github.com/TikhonJelvis">GitHub</a> accounts are
  interesting.
