<p>
  I have a nice
  <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/tikhonjelvis"> 
    HTML R&eacute;sum&eacute;/CV</a> at
  StackOverflow Careers.
</p>
<p>
  I used to have a paper r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but I've been too lazy
  to maintain it and now it is over a year out of date. For a college
  student, a year is important! You can read
  it <a href="../resume.pdf">here</a>, but it's little more than a
  curio.

  Apart from my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, I think
  my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/286871/tikhon-jelvis">StackOverflow
  profile</a> (not careers.stackoverflow)
  and <a href="http://github.com/TikhonJelvis">GitHub</a> accounts are
  interesting.
