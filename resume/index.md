# Résumé

I have a nice [HTML CV](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/tikhonjelvis) at StackOverflow Careers. I tend to keep this fairly up to date, mostly out of vanity.

I used to have a paper résumé, but I've been too lazy
to maintain it and now it is approaching two years out of date. For a
college student, even a year is important! You can still [download it](resume.pdf), but it's little more than a
curio.

# Other Sites

Apart from my résumé, I think my normal [StackOverflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/286871/tikhon-jelvis) and my [GitHub account](http://github.com/TikhonJelvis) are interesting.
