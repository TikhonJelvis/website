I am a second-year Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS)

interested in programming languages and functional
programming.

EECS
</h2>
<p>
EECS stands for "Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences", which
is really a bit of a mouthful, so everybody just calls it "EECS"
(pronounced "eeks"). This major is the union of CS and EE, and so is a
superset of what most schools refer to as "computer
engineering"&mdash;an EECS major can get a "computer
engineering"-style education, but can also study either EE or CS
almost exclusively.
</p>
<p>
I am a big fan of the EECS major because of its extreme
flexibility&mdash;I not only have freedom within EE and CS, but I also
have freedom without it: I am free, and have enough time, to take
classes just from interest without worrying unduly about graduation
requirements. Additionally, I think this major is particularly well
suited for people who, like me, are primarily interested in
CS&mdash;electrical engineering may be boring, but some is necessary,
and I will probably get a more thorough grounding in it than I would
in a pure CS program.
</p>
<h2 class="header">
Programming
</h2>
<p>
I have been programming on my own for a relatively long time now. My
very first exposure to actual programming was in seventh grade,
towards the latter half of 2004, when I started learning
JavaScript. The state of JavaScript at that time was very different
from now; I remember commenting out the actual code inside the
<span class="code">script</span> tag because older browsers did not
acknowledge script tags at all&mdash;a positively ancient practice!
</p>
<p>
Since then, I have continued to program on my own. Initially, I was
concentrating almost entirely on mechanics&mdash;I was having enough
difficulty doing anything at all, so I didn't even consider trying to
finish anything coherent. Later on, I began to work on increasingly
complex projects; however, thanks to poor practices and lack of
back-ups, most of my very early projects have disappeared
irrevocably.
</p>
<p>
As time went on, my technical grasp of programming improved, as did my
practices. On this site I have my larger projects since junior year of
high school. This was the time when I went from just tinkering to
actually programming; I stopped programming just to program and
started actually making things.
</p>
<h3 class="header">
  Projects
</h3>
<p>
This site has pages for several of my projects. Simulation and Chess
are from high school; TPL and Cards are from my first two years of
college. 
</p>
<p>
I have a bunch of other projects as well. All the most recent ones are
on <a href="http://www.github.com/TikhonJelvis" title="My github
page.">github</a>. I also mean to move my old projects to github (they are
mostly on Google code right now), but I will probably never get around to it.
