Welcome
</h1>
<p>
I am a freshman Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS)
major at the University of California, Berkeley. I am particularly
interested in computer science and programming. Additionally, I am
casually interested in digital typography, fencing and ping pong.
</p>

EECS
</h2>
<p>
EECS stands for "Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences", which
is really a bit of a mouthful, so everybody just calls it "EECS"
(pronounced "eeks"). This major is a superset of what most schools
refer to as "computer engineering"&mdash;an EECS major can get a
"computer engineering"-style education, but can also study either EE
or CS almost exclusively.
</p>
<p>
I am a big fan of the EECS major because of its extreme
flexibility&mdash;I not only have freedom within EE and CS, but I also
have freedom without it: I am free, and have enough time, to take
classes just from interest without worrying unduly about graduation
requirements. Additionally, I think this major is particularly well
suited for people who, like me, are primarily interested in
CS&mdash;electrical engineering may be boring, but some is necessary,
and I will probably get a more thorough grounding in it than I would
in a pure CS major.

Projects
</h2>
<p>
I have been programming on my own for a relatively long time now. My
very first exposure to actual programming was in seventh grade,
towards the latter half of 2004, when I started learning
JavaScript. The state of JavaScript at that time was very different
from now; I remember commenting out the actual code inside the
<span class="code">script</span> tag because older browsers did not
acknowledge script tags at all. This has not been necessary for years!
</p>
<p>
Ever since learning JavaScript on my own, I have continued to
program. Initially, I was concentrating almost entirely on
mechanics&mdash;I was having enough difficulty doing anything at all,
so I didn't even consider trying to finish something coherent. Later
on, I began to work on increasingly large projects; however, thanks to
my poor practices and lack of back ups, most of my very early projects
are irrevocably gone.
</p>
<p>
After this, I continued to program in my spare time, sometimes using
my new skills for school projects, but generally only playing
around. During freshman year of high school, I decided to learn a new
language and picked Perl; while I did not end up learning it in any
great depth, it is still I tool I use once in a while for various
things.

  Simulation
</h3>
<p>
I took my first CS class during junior year of high school; here I
learned Java, my first compiled language. I wrote several projects
during this time, but lost the first couple on a flash drive. I
learned to keep back ups after that! The last project of junior year
was the most interesting. I was assigned a <em>very</em> open-ended
project for physics, so decided, along with some friends, to write a
program for it.
</p>
<p>
The chess game and the simulation were not written alone; I worked with
Jacob Taylor, a friend who is now studying CS at Stanford. His page can be found
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~jacobt">here</a>. For the simulation, he
worked on modeling the polygons, doing all of the actual math while I
worked on the interface and putting the entire project together. For
the chess game, he ported a chess AI he had written earlier to
JavaScript. While we both have a very similar JavaScript plotting tool
on our sites, we actually came up with them completely independently.

This Site
</h2>
<p>
This site is currently hosted on the EECS instructional Unix server at
inst.eecs.berkeley.edu. This page is build with xhtml and
CSS. The typeface used is Verdana, which is my favorite web typeface,
by far. Most of the text on this page is just padding to make it look
better; I will add text worth reading in the future. Perhaps I will
also add some pictures, or something.
