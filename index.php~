Welcome
</h1>
<p>
This is the public page of Tikhon Jelvis, an EECS student at the
University of California, Berkeley. This site contains some of the
projects I have worked on, sometimes by myself and sometimes with
friends. Some additional information can be found in the "About"
section.

EECS
</h2>
<p>
EECS stands for "Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences", which
is really a bit of a mouthful, so everybody just calls it "EECS"
(pronounced "eeks"). This major is a superset of what most schools
refer to as "computer engineering"&mdash;an EECS major can get a
"computer engineering"-style education, but can also study either EE
or CS almost exclusively.

Projects
</h2>
<p>
I worked on the projects gathered here throughout the last several
years&mdash;I started on the first one here (the simulation) in the
second semester of my junior year in high school, and I've worked on
some of the other projects very recently. The projects do not
represent the extent of my programming; rather, they represent the
larger works that I actually finished. I tend to stop working on
smaller projects, leaving them to stagnate and finally forgetting
about them.
</p>

<p>
The chess game and the simulation were not written alone; I worked with
Jacob Taylor, a friend who is now studying CS at Stanford. His page can be found
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~jacobt">here</a>. For the simulation, he
worked on modeling the polygons, doing all of the actual math while I
worked on the interface and putting the entire project together. For
the chess game, he ported a chess AI he had written earlier to
JavaScript. While we both have a very similar JavaScript plotting tool
on our sites, we actually came up with them completely independently.

This Site
</h2>
<p>
This site is currently hosted on the EECS instructional Unix server at
inst.eecs.berkeley.edu. This page is build with xhtml and
CSS. The typeface used is Verdana, which is my favorite web typeface,
by far. Most of the text on this page is just padding to make it look
better; I will add text worth reading in the future. Perhaps I will
also add some pictures, or something.
