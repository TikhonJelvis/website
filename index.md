# Welcome
![Me on the roof of the Casa Milà in Barcelona. For even more Guadí, you can barely see the Sagrada Família in the background.](img/me_at_casa_mila_med.jpg)

I am a student particularly interested in programming languages, functional programming, program synthesis, semantics, type theory and startups (not necessarily in that order!). In the near future I want to combine as many of these as possible.

Most recently, I have been looking into total functional programming, universal algebra and functional reactive programming. Writing programs that are well-defined for all inputs but do *not* necessarily terminate is very fascinating---these models allow using a language that is not Turing-complete to write things like web servers and UIs, which in turn makes it easier to ensure correctness.

I also have experience in developer tools and web development (both on the front end and the back end, with more emphasis on the former). I am very enthusiastic about free and open-source software, particularly Emacs and Linux, although virtually everything I run on my computer is FOSS.

Outside CS, I'm an avid skier and a sabre fencer (albeit on hiatus). I'm oddly fascinated by typography---one of these days, I'm going to design my own typeface. I like literature, particularly anything with an existential bent, and progressive metal.
