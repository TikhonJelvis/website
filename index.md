I'm a programmer with a background in functional programming and programming languages. I'm applying ideas from these fields to operations research at Target—we're developing a framework for expressing and solving large-scale stochastic optimization problems.

I enjoy writing and giving talks about CS. Check out my [talks] and my writing on my [blog], [Stack Overflow][so] and [Quora].
