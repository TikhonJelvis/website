Started at Target, designing a Haskell DSL for operations research.

Two recent talks, both recorded:

  * [Introduction to FRP](talks/frp-2016) at the [East Bay Haskell meetup][eb-haskell]
  * [Analyzing Programs with Z3](talks/compose-2016) at [Compose 2016][compose] in NYC

I'm a programmer with a focus on programming languages and functional programming. At the moment, I'm working at Target as a "Lead Data Scientist"[^title] developing a domain-specific language for operations research.

I enjoy presenting about CS and try to give [talks](talks) regularly. I like writing as well but haven't updated my blog in a whileâ€”I'm more active on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Tikhon-Jelvis/answers) and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/286871/tikhon-jelvis), writing mostly (but not entirely) about CS.

[^title]: I didn't choose my job title! It's not very representative of what I actually do.

    But even if I had a choice, what title would really describe what I'm doing? It's not quite research, but it's not quite not research either. Sometimes it even involves category theory.

### Background

I studied CS at Berkeley, with an informal focus on programming languages. I worked on an undergraduate research project on program synthesis with Professor Bodik at the ParLab. The project was [Chlorophyll], a synthesis-aided compiler for low-power architectures and resulted in a paper at [PLDI 2014][pldi].

Apart from research I also interned at a few different companies from a mid-size enterprise software company to several (very) early stage startups. One highlight was a summer at Jane Street Capital, a proprietary trading firm in New York famous for using OCaml. Seeing the raw power of typed functional programming at scale there cemented my preference for ML-style languages, although I still go for Haskell over OCaml.

Over all, I rather enjoyed research and would have been interested in grad school but unfortunately ended up dropping out after junior year (for a mix of reasons). It's all a bit of a mess but I'm still interested in getting back into research and grad school in the future---for now, though, I'm at Target because the project and team were too awesome to pass up.

Outside CS, I'm an avid skier and a saber fencer (albeit on hiatus). I'm casually interested in typography and typefaces---if I was a designer, I'd be doing something minimalist with text. I like literature, particularly anything with an existential bent, and a range of experimental music from progressive metal to minimalist compositions and modern jazz.

## Contact

Email me at [tikhon@jelv.is](mailto:tikhon@jelv.is). I am always happy to respond, especially about Haskell. However, I might take a while. If I don't write back for a couple of days, please feel free to prod me again: I occasionally lose track of emails even if I have a response.
