# Welcome

<div class="announcement">
Our paper on Chlorophyll, a synthesis-aided compiler, was accepted to [PLDI 2014](http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/pldi2014/acceptedpapers.html)!.

All of my slides are now available on my [talks](talks) page, including:

  * [Polymorphism (System F)](talks/system-f.html) ([pdf](talks/system-f.pdf))
  * [Dependent Types](talks/dependent-types.html) ([pdf](talks/dependent-types.pdf))

My main interests are: programming languages, functional programming, program synthesis, semantics, type theory and startups (not necessarily in that order!). In the near future I want to combine as many of these as possible.

I've worked at a few different companies including several startups and Jane Street Capital, a trading firm that is the largest commercial user of OCaml. I've also done some research on program synthesis at the Berkeley ParLab with professor Bodik.

I have experience in developer tools and web development (both on the front end and the back end, with more emphasis on the former). I am very enthusiastic about free and open-source software, particularly Emacs and Linux---virtually everything I run on my computer is F/OSS.

Outside CS, I'm an avid skier and a saber fencer (albeit on hiatus). I'm oddly fascinated by typography---one of these days, I'm going to design my own typeface. I like literature, particularly anything with an existential bent, and progressive metal.
