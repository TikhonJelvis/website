# Welcome

<div class="announcement">
I gave two lightning talks at [BayHac 2013](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/BayHac2013):

  * [Program synthesis](af-slides.html) for GreenArrays
  * [Algebras and Coalgebras](algebras.html), based on [a post I wrote](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16015020/what-does-coalgebra-mean-in-the-context-of-programming/16022059#16022059)

And a longer talk at [Hac φ](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hac_%CF%86):

  * [Program synthesis](synthesis-slides.html) (a general overview)

I am a student particularly interested in programming languages, functional programming, program synthesis, semantics, type theory and startups (not necessarily in that order!). In the near future I want to combine as many of these as possible. Currently, I'm an intern at [Jane Street Capital](http://www.janestreet.com/), one of the biggest and best functional programming companies in the world.

Most recently, I have been looking into total functional programming, universal algebra and functional reactive programming. Writing programs that are well-defined for all inputs but do *not* necessarily terminate is very fascinating---these models allow using a language that is not Turing-complete to write things like web servers and UIs, which in turn makes it easier to ensure correctness.

I also have experience in developer tools and web development (both on the front end and the back end, with more emphasis on the former). I am very enthusiastic about free and open-source software, particularly Emacs and Linux, although virtually everything I run on my computer is FOSS.

Outside CS, I'm an avid skier and a sabre fencer (albeit on hiatus). I'm oddly fascinated by typography---one of these days, I'm going to design my own typeface. I like literature, particularly anything with an existential bent, and progressive metal.

Please feel free to contact me for any reason at <a href="mailto:tikhon@jelv.is">tikhon@jelv.is</a>. I am always happy to respond to emails, although I may take a while. I also use Jabber (Google Talk), and will probably be happy to chat if I'm online.
