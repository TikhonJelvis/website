My main interests are: programming languages, functional programming, program synthesis, semantics, type theory and startups (not necessarily in that order!). In the near future I want to combine as many of these as possible.

I've worked at a few different companies including several startups and Jane Street Capital, a trading firm that is the largest commercial user of OCaml. I've also done some research on program synthesis at the Berkeley ParLab with professor Bodik.

I have experience in developer tools and web development (both on the front end and the back end, with more emphasis on the former). I am very enthusiastic about free and open-source software, particularly Emacs and Linux---virtually everything I run on my computer is F/OSS.

Outside CS, I'm an avid skier and a saber fencer (albeit on hiatus). I'm oddly fascinated by typography---one of these days, I'm going to design my own typeface. I like literature, particularly anything with an existential bent, and progressive metal.
