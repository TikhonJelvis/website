      Problems
  </h2>
  <p>
    This page does not currently work on certain versions of Chromium
    and Google Chrome due to this issue:
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=62123">Issue
      62123</a> Only certain builds of version 9 seem to be affected;
      version 9.0.582.0 (0) of Chromium exhibits the bug, while
      version 9.0.597.83 of Google Chrome doesn't. There do not seem
      to be any problems on version 8, which is the stable release.

    Unfortunately, the AI does not work particularly well on browsers
    with slower Javascript engines, including older versions of
    Firefox. While it should still <em>work</em>, the response
    time may be horrible and it may slow down the browser enough to
    get a pop-up warning.

     Details
  </h2>
  <p>
   This game was a project I worked on for fun during my second
   semester of senior year in high school. The idea was to learn how
   to use JavaScript in the browser while making something actually
   <em>useful</em>. The game did, ultimately, prove useful&mdash;I
   played several games against my friend on a smartboard at school,
   something that I can't really do any more since smartboards seem to
   be exclusively in the domain of elementary and high school.

   The AI for this game was created by <a
   href="http://www.stanford.edu/~jacobt">Jacob Taylor</a>. He based
   this on an AI he had written earlier in LISP; the project page for
   that AI can be found <a
   href="http://code.google.com/p/multi-game-ai/">here</a>. Once he
   had ported the AI to JavaScript, integrating it into the game was
   trivial.

   Being a program entirely written in JavaSript, xhtml and CSS, it
   has always been inherently open source. However, the code has also
   formally been released under an MIT license, and has a project page
   on Google code found <a
   href="http://code.google.com/p/maptac-chess">here</a>.
