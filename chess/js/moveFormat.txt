The String Representation of a Move

A move is generally represented as a pair of squares. The squares are
referred to by their coordinates, with the letter first and lower-case
(e.g. a1, e4, g8...). There should be a hyphen separating the two
squares. The square where the piece that is to move started out comes
first; the square where it moved comes second. A full move like this
would be "e2-e4" or the like. 

For promotion, the move is written as normal ("e7-e8", for example),
and the type of piece the pawn is promoted to is appended to this
preceded by an asterisk (*), resulting in something like ("e7-e8*Q")
for a promotion to a queen. The type of piece that the pawn is
promoted to should be one letter, like it is in algebraic notation,
except it can be either lowercase or uppercase.

For castling, the move can be only one of the following: ("0-0") for
king-side or ("0-0-0") for queen-side. Nothing else will work.
