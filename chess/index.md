# Maptac Chess

You can see the moves made in the game by clicking the left tab and the captured pieces by clicking the right tab.

This game was a project I worked on for fun during my second semester of senior year in high school. The idea was to learn how to use JavaScript in the browser while making something actually useful. The game did, ultimately, prove usefulâ€”I played several games against my friend on a smartboard at school, something that I can't really do any more since smartboards seem to be exclusively in the domain of elementary and high school.

The AI for this game was created by [Jessica Taylor](http://jessic.at). She based this on an AI she had written earlier in LISP; the project page for that AI can be found here. Once she had ported the AI to JavaScript, integrating it into the game was trivial.

The code is available under an MIT license on [GitHub](https://github.com/TikhonJelvis/Maptac-Chess).
